Edge-Powered Solution for Taking Attendance Using Facial Recognition

The conventional methods employed for attendance tracking in workplaces, schools, and
colleges have long been characterized by labor-intensive and manual processes, resulting
in various challenges. These traditional procedures not only consume substantial time
but also leave room for errors as bosses and teachers manually record attendance. The
inherent manual work introduces discrepancies and inaccuracies, potentially leading to
payroll issues, especially for companies that pay employees hourly. Furthermore, the
laborious nature of the process squanders valuable time that could otherwise be utilized
for more productive activities.
To address these limitations and propel attendance tracking into the modern age, our
internship project took on the ambitious task of developing an innovative solution. The
central objective was to create a cutting-edge web application, leveraging the power of
facial recognition technology, to streamline and revolutionize the attendance recording
process for both students and employees. The integration of facial recognition served as
the key mechanism in simplifying and automating attendance-taking significantly,
minimizing human errors, and ensuring enhanced accuracy in tracking attendance data.
The proposed web app offers unparalleled ease of use, as users can effortlessly mark
attendance with a simple facial scan. Upon matching the scanned face with existing data,
the app automatically records the attendance for that individual, rendering the entire
process swift, efficient, and seamless. By eliminating the need for manual data entry and
potential inaccuracies, our solution proves itself as a reliable and dependable
tool for attendance management.
One of the key advantages of our solution lies in its inclusivity, catering to organizations
and educational institutions of all sizes. By removing the necessity for expensive
biometric machines, our cost-effective approach empowers a wide range of
establishments to benefit from a sophisticated attendance tracking system. Regardless of

financial capacity, businesses, schools, and colleges can readily adopt and leverage our
web app to manage attendance with utmost ease and efficiency.
In conclusion, our proposed web application embodies a pioneering endeavor to
modernize and optimize attendance-tracking practices across diverse establishments. By
effectively addressing the time-consuming and error-prone aspects of manual methods,
our solution seeks to revolutionize traditional attendance-taking processes. Through the
seamless integration of facial recognition technology, our app not only facilitates swift
and effortless attendance marking but also empowers organizations to efficiently manage
their workforce or students. The user-friendly and cost-effective nature of our solution,
coupled with its accuracy and reliability, fosters a new era of attendance management,
promoting greater efficiency and accuracy in day-to-day operations.
